# Hover
*A new way for commuters to come together and carpool.*

#### About
The Hover project is currently under development.

This repo contains the backend code for the app, a RESTful API built in Ruby on Rails to be called via Android and iOS frontend clients. It uses a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension to manage commuter data and match users for carpools.
